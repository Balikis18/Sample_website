    <h1> The learn enough story </h1>
    <p>
    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="
				      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berner-Lee">
	    Tim Berner-Lee</a> It is not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
    		share picture of his cat, but it would be cool of it it were

    	Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are at least<strong> a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
      learning<em> technical sophistication,</em>` probably more. To join our

	    <h2> Background </h2>
	    <p>
	     Learn enough to be dangerous is an outgrowth of the
	     <a href="https://railstutorial.org/"> Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
	     and the <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn
			     enough HTML to be dangerous</em></a> which 
	     teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
	     <strong>M</strong>arkup<strong>L</strong>anguage. The universal 
	     language of the world wide web.
	     other related tutorials can be found at <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">learn enough.com</a>

	    <h2> Founders </h2>
	    <p>
	     Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
	     Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of<em> technical
		     sophistication</em> taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      at<strong> least a billion people,</strong> and probably more.

	    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

	    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
